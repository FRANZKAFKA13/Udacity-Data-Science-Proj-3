# Udacity-Data-Science-Proj-3: Recommendation Engines

This repository contains the code I wrote for tackling project 3 in the [Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) by Udacity.


## Functionality

The recommendation engine is written in only one file, the "Recommendatoins_with_IBM" JupyterNotebook. It can be executed as usual after cloning the repo.

The notebook contains the following content in order to making user recommendations on articles within the IBM Watson Studio platform.
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Rank-based recommendations
* User-user based simple collaborative filtering
* Matrix factorization (sub-category of collaborative filtering using SVD)

## Built With

* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) - Used for coding and documentation

## Authors
